### Eat-Da-Burger

This app uses an Express.js server to get and post burger objects via an ORM mediary. 

Front-end data is handled with jQuery, with Ajax functions to parse data through to our API. The data is then sent to our mySql database using the ORM to communicate with mySql and the controller to route requests. 

HTML is rendered using Handlebars. 

No animals were harmed in the making of this app.
